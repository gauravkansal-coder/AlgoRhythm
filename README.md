# 🎵 AlgoRhythm

**AlgoRhythm** is a code-reactive music engine. It listens to your typing speed in real-time and remixes the background music to match your flow—calm when you think, intense when you code.

This script detects your typing activity and sends it to the cloud dashboard.

Bash
node remote-spy.js
Note: You need Node.js installed.
